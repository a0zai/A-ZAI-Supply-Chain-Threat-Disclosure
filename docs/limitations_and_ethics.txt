# Limitations of the Model & Ethical Responsibility Statement

This repository and the content within do not represent a finalized attack tool, nor do they intend to provide a ready-to-use malicious implementation. It is strictly a Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to demonstrate a structural supply chain threat that could theoretically be exploited within software ecosystems.

‚úÖ All scripts and files included in this disclosure:
- Are simplified examples intended for educational and analytical purposes only.
- Can be modified and extended, but in their current form, they are not harmful or deployable in real-world environments.
- Were designed to raise awareness and demonstrate the feasibility of the structural threat, without developing a full-scale exploitation tool.

‚ö†Ô∏è I intentionally avoided deep development, weaponization, or public dissemination of a real exploit, out of respect for ethical and legal boundaries in the field of cybersecurity.

üéØ The primary goals of this disclosure are:
- To raise awareness about this under-documented structural threat model.
- To encourage improvement of detection and protection mechanisms in software supply chains.
- To technically demonstrate that such a threat is possible and should be considered.

Any misuse, unethical adaptation, or weaponization of this concept beyond the scope of responsible research **is not my responsibility** and will have no association with me, legally or ethically.

With kind regards,
[Rafat khalil]
