The A0Z-MP project proposes a novel decentralized movement protocol for dynamic mesh networks.
Instead of relying on traditional GPS coordinates or centralized routing tables, A0Z-MP organizes nodes based on human-inspired movement sequences:
- **F** (Footstep) – representing larger movement steps.
- **H** (Handspan) – representing fine-tuned minor adjustments.
The protocol is lightweight, flexible, scalable, and designed for building organic, evolving network topologies without strict dependency on external infrastructure.
